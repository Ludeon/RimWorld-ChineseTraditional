  <!-- EN: A genetically-engineered variant of potato adapted for growing in polluted areas. Compared to regular potatoes, toxipotatoes take less time to grow but yield a meager harvest of food. When eaten raw, they have a high chance of causing food poisoning. In spite of this, they have saved many settlers from starvation after toxic events. -->
  <Plant_Toxipotato.description>馬鈴薯的基因改造變種，能適應生長在受污染地區。相比一般馬鈴薯，毒馬鈴薯長得更快，但產出較少。生吃時，會有高機率引起食物中毒。儘管如此，毒馬鈴薯填飽了很多遭遇有毒災難的殖民者。</Plant_Toxipotato.description>
