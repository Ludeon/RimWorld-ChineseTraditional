  <Mechanitor.label>御機使的故事</Mechanitor.label>
  <!-- EN: You knew you could only achieve greatness with help. People were too unreliable, so you chose to take on mechanoids as your servants, workers, and warriors. As you gained strength, others became fearful. It became clear you needed to get away from the influence of humanity. Now you've migrated to this sparsely-populated rimworld with some of your metallic helpers. Finally, you have the space to grasp your true potential!\n\nNote: Since your starting character will lack some skills, this is a difficult scenario. -->
  <Mechanitor.description>你知道只有在幫助下才能成就大業。但人們太不可靠了，所以你選擇了機械族作為你的僕人、工人和戰士。當你獲得力量後，其他人就變得恐懼。很明顯，你需要擺脫人類的影響。現在你已經和你的金屬助手一起遷移到了這個人煙稀少的邊緣世界。終於，你有空間去掌握你真正的潛力了!\n\n注意：由於你的起始角色會缺乏一些技能，所以這是一個困難的腳本。</Mechanitor.description>

  <!-- EN: When a dark stranger offered you a cure for your cancer, you were ready to agree to anything. He made you into a sanguophage - an immortal blood-drinker hated by a thousand religions. You hid your condition for years, but eventually a hunter tracked you down. Stowing away on the first starship leaving the system, you barely escaped alive.\n\nNote: Sanguophages have unique strengths and weaknesses, which makes this a difficult scenario. -->
