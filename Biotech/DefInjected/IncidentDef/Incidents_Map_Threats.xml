  <!-- EN: A group of burrowed insect stasis cocoons have picked up the scent of a recently-dissolved toxic wastepack. They're tunneling upwards to get closer to the chemicals!\n\nThe cocoons will emerge in a dormant state. They will remain dormant indefinitely. If someone approaches or disturbs them, they will open and release enraged insects. -->
