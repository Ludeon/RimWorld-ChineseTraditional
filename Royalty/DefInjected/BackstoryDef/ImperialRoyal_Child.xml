  <!-- EN: [PAWN_nameDef]'s parents did not want another heir. Fearing a succession fight, they decided to neutralize [PAWN_objective] early.\n\nThey pampered [PAWN_nameDef] from birth, preventing [PAWN_objective] from developing the grit or knowledge necessary to be a threat to their favored son. [PAWN_nameDef] learned little more than how to manipulate the royal staff to get more food. -->

  <!-- EN: [PAWN_nameDef]'s noble family did not want [PAWN_objective], but could not afford to be seen directly assassinating [PAWN_objective] either. They attempted to get [PAWN_objective] killed by assigning [PAWN_objective] dangerous training without proper protection at too young an age.\n\nAgainst all odds, [PAWN_nameDef] survived the jousting contests, horsewar matches, riverrun competitions and warzones. In the end, it only made [PAWN_objective] stronger. -->
